# numu_disappearance
Idealised analysis of muon neutrino disappearance in SBND.

Start only with the ICARUS detector and input flux and cross-section files and find the 90%, 3 sd and 5sd confidence level contours for the 3+1 sterile neutrino phase space (mass splitting, angle).

Then consider the case where our knowledge of the input flux is only 30% accurate. See that ruins our sensitivity so we add a near detector: measure the flux early on to replace the (30%) systematic uncertainty with a (smaller) counting/statistical uncertainty. Recover much of our lost sensitivity.

Finally, do some studies of the effect of exposure and detector resolution on the sesitivities.
